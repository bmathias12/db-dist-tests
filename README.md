# db-dist-tests
Statistical tests for distribution changes

# TODO

- Change in continuous dist
    - Does the measure of central tendancy change?
    - Should we also capture the full distribution (KS?)
- Change in categorical dist
    - Are the categories the same?
    - Does the count distribution change?
- Create class for managing different tests using consistent API
